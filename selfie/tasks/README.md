#### consensus_sim.py
Simulates the execution of the consensus algorithm to determine the final value among the crowdsourced values for each image.

#### create_dict.py
Creates or augments a wordcount dictionary (eliminating all the special characters) from some TSV (specimen, value) file.

#### create_dict_sim.py
Simulates the creation of a dictionary from a data file

#### crowdsource_sim.py
